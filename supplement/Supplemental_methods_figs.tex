\section {Data overview}
This document  describes the data cleaning, subsetting, and aggregation methods specific to each dataset.
Table \ref{metadata} lists the datasets included in the meta-analysis.
We plot species accumulation curves, spatio-temporal variation in the number of taxa observed, the spatio-temporal sampling effort, and the number of taxa shared by each pairwise combination of plots within the study.
%We also identify any potential issues with the data.
% We visually evaluated the species accumulation curves and temporal patterns in species abundances to screen for changes in sampling methods or data recording methods over the course of the study that could affect results.
% A sudden jump in the cumulative number of taxa, for example, could indicate that taxa were recorded to a finer resolution (not that more taxa appeared  at the site).  
% A species accumulation curve that does not level off could indicate a community undergoing rapid succession, invasion, or environmental change. 
%For each dataset, we evaluated whether all sites were observed with equal effort in all years of study and we document any years, sites, sampling occasions, or species that were dropped from the dataset prior to analysis. 
 %We also document the method used to aggregate the data to an annual value for each species at each site.
%We visually evaluated the species accumulation curves and temporal patters in species abundances to screen for changes in sampling methods or data recording methods over the course of the study that could affect results.
%For example, a sudden jump in the number of taxa in a given year could indicate that taxa were recorded to a finer resolution (not that more taxa were actually present at the site).  
%We also checked to be sure an abundance of zero was recorded for each absence (i.e. we made sure zeros were filled in for site-years in which a species was not observed).
%We removed species codes that obviously represent `unknown' species.
%{\bf Do we use cutoff criteria to remove rare species prior to analysis? 
% If so, we  should probably include that code in formatting script for each site so that the Supplemental figures and L3 data product we publish match the data used in analysis.}
%We also include a table of datasets that were considered, and that we prepared into the L3 format, but ultimately were not included in the analysis (Table \ref{not_used}).

\subsection {sbc-allTaxa}
We downloaded from the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) annual taxon-specific estimates of the biomass density (g dry/m$^2$) of kelp forest macroalgae, sessile invertebrates, mobile invertebrates, and fishes in the Santa Barbara Channel \citep{sbc}.
Briefly, between 2000-2004 and 2022, divers estimated the summer taxon-specific density or percentage cover of 225 taxa within 2â€“8 permanent transects (2 m wide x 40 m long) at each of 11 sites (44 total transects). 
Abundance and size were converted to dry biomass using taxon-specific relationships developed for the study region. 
Detailed methods are available in \citep{Harrer2013, Reed2016, sbc}.
Data are shown in Figures \ref{sbc-algae},  \ref{sbc-sessileInverts}, \ref{sbc-mobileInverts}, and \ref{sbc-fish}.

%Moorea Coral Reef (MCR) LTER
%We downloaded from EDI annual taxon-specific estimates of the percentage cover of stony corals (Edmunds 2022), benthic algae (Carpenter 2023), invertebrates (Carpenter 2023), and fishes (Brooks 2022). Briefly, between 2005 and 2021, divers surveyed corals using photoquadrats (0.5 m x 0.5 m) along a permanent 40-m transect in each of 4 habitats at 6 sites surrounding the island of Moorea (24 total transects): fringing reef, lagoon (backreef), shallow outer reef (10 m depth on forereef), and deep outer reef (17 m depth on forereef; Edmunds 2022). Benthic algae were estimated in a similar way, except that 0.5 m x 0.5 m photoquadrats were recorded at 5 permanent 10-m transects per site-habitat combination (Carpenter 2023). Invertebrate herbivores and corallivores were counted in 1 m2 quadrats along the same transects (Carpenter 2022). Fishes were visually estimated by divers along four 5 m x 50 m transects per site-habitat combination (Brooks 2022). Detailed methods are available in Brooks (2022), Carpenter (2022, 2023), and Edmunds (2022).

\subsection {mcr-inverts}
{\bf Need to get updated data. Need to separate by habitat. Needs data package citation.}
Data were downloaded from EDI (knb-lter-mcr.7.28).
Data were aggregated across habitats and transects.
Thus each of the six sites contains data from very different habitats lumped together (back, fringing, outer reefs) and there is likely very little overlap in the species found in each habitat. 
This is different than the other datasets, and it would be good to discuss whether or not to separate by habitat.
Non-relevant taxa and taxa observed outside the quadrat were removed from the dataset.
Abundance was averaged across subplots, transects, and habitats for each species at each site in each year.
Data are in Figure \ref{mcr-inverts}.
It's unclear whether these are mobile inverts, sessile inverts, or both (need to know for comparison with SBC).

\subsection {mcr-fish}
{\bf Updated data in ecocomdp format on EDI. Need to prepare it for this analysis. Need to separate by habitat. Needs data package citation.}
Data were downloaded from EDI (knb-lter-mcr.6.54).
Data were aggregated across habitats and transects.
Thus each of the six sites contains data from very different habitats lumped together (backreef, forereef, fringing) and there is likely very little overlap in the species found in each habitat. 
This is different than the other datasets, and it would be good to discuss whether or not to separate by habitat.
Non-relevant taxa codes (e.g. ``No fish present") were removed from the dataset.
Abundance was recorded as dry biomass per 250 $m^2$, averaged across subplots, transects, and habitats for each species at each site in each year.
Data are in Figure \ref{mcr-fish}.
Six extra locations in forereef habitats were sampled in 2015.
These appear to be in addition to the four transects per habitat per site performed as part of the long term data collections, and thus they were removed from the dataset prior to analysis.

\section {Freshwater datasets}

\subsection {fce-diatoms}
Data were obtained from the PI.
Metadata and citation can be found on EDI \citep{fce-diatoms}.
Diatom abundance collected from 800m x 800m Principal Sampling Units (hereafter called `sites') distributed across the Florida Everglades. 
%Data retained for analysis include 192 total diatom taxa from 30 sites sampled at least once per year for 7 consecutive years. 
Full data set included 367 diatom taxa and 171 sites; however, not all sites were sampled every year. 
We retained sites from Shark River Slough (SRS) and Taylor Slough (TSL) of Everglades National Park that were sampled in 7 consecutive years. 
Diatom abundance was aggregated as yearly mean of four samples collected per year (three samples for 2006). 
%All unknown species and species that were not detected over the time series at these sites were removed.
Data are shown in Figure \ref{fce-diatoms}

\subsection {fce-fish}
% {\bf Need to select wet or dry season.}
Data were obtained from the PI, and are cataloged on EDI  \citep{fce-fish}.
Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was calculated as (count/distance)*100
For each species, the CPUE was aggregated by summing the CPUE measured in each bout (i.e., replicate) within each Creek Number | River | YEAR | Season combination.
The format was re-arranged to reflect the aggregated CPUE (`total CPUE') per season as columns and mean CPUE column was created by averaging the CPUE across the three seasons.
NOTE: After the first preliminary examination of the aggregated CPUE values the mean CPUE was ignored due to the unbalanced observations across the years and seasons. 
So, only the observations in the Wet and Dry season were considered.
Dry season: In this set, only the sites within RB were considered to create a balanced design for the analysis. 
Thus, this set encompassed a longer temporal range with a cost of less spatial replication.
NOTE: Also, YEAR 2004-2005 and 2011 were eliminated due to incomplete representation across the sites
Wet season: In this set both RB and TB were considered but only after 2010. Thus, this set has a wider spatial replication but a shorter temporal range.
NOTE: The difference in the spatial replication between seasons is related to the limitation of the sampling approach (electrofishing) which is limited to low salinity conditions. 
Salinity threshold for electrofishing is often reached in TB during the Dry season (i.e., TB is considered the estuarine portion of the Shark River System).
Data from the dry season are shown in Figure \ref{fce-fish-dry}.
Data from the wet season are shown in Figure \ref{fce-fish-wet}.

\subsection {ntl-zooplankton}
The data were downloaded from the EDI Data Portal \citep{ntl-zooplankton}.
Samples were taken  via vertical tows at fortnightly intervals on a minimum of five occasions per year (range = 5 - 18 occasions per year).
Density was recorded as number of individuals per liter for each taxa, integrated volumetrically over the water column.
Many taxa are identified to species level, but some are identified to genus level.
Lake `Tr'  was only sampled in one year and was assumed to be the same as lake `TR'. 
The initial year (1981) was removed from analysis because only five of the seven sites were sampled.
We additionally removed 165 records with missing or unknown taxa designations.
Data were aggregated annually for each taxa in each lake by taking the maximum density observed in a tow sampling occasion.
Data are shown in Figure \ref{ntl-zooplankton}.

Data on fish abundance were downloaded from the EDI Data Portal \citep{ntl-fish}.
Seine net data from five northern lakes (Allequash, Big Muskellunge, Crystal, Sparkling, and Trout Lakes)  were included (1981 - 2017).
Data from the two bog lakes (Crystal Bog and Trout Bog) were not included.

\subsection {and-plants}
We downloaded the data from ecological archives \citep{cdr-del_moral_thirty_2010}. We retained data from 12 plots at a single site, Abraham Plain, which provides annual data on a primary succession on pumice, with no gaps, from 1989 to 2009. All individuals of this dataset were identified to the species level. Data are shown in Figure \ref{and-plants}.

\subsection {cdr-plants}
Data were downloaded from EDI \citep{cdr-plants}.
Annual censuses are incomplete after 2004, so we only consider data from 1982 until 2004. 
We used data from control plots only, from all four sites (A, B, C, and D). 
Fields A, B, and C were considered together as a single dataset, while D was considered a separate dataset because of its unique fire history.
We prepared taxonomic data by cleaning clear mistakes (such as `carex sp.' instead of `Carex sp.'), removed non-taxonomic entities (``Miscellaneous litter") and non-plant taxa (`Fungi', and `Mosses \& lichens').
We also lumped or dropped certain taxonomic information. 
Specifically, we lumped taxonomic information to the genus level when more than 1$\%$ of the biomass of a genus was not identified to the species level. 
For example, {\it Cyperus} species are usually identified to the genus level (``Cyperus  sp.") rather than species level (``{\it Cyperus schweinitzii}''), with a minority of the biomass (less than 10$\%$) identified at the specific level. 
We therefore consider only genus information for {\it Cyperus}. 
We dropped taxonomic information when within a certain genus, biomass is identified to the genus level. 
For example, in the genus {\it Viola}, more than 99.8$\%$ of biomass was determined to the species level. We therefore dropped from the dataset the instances when biomass is assigned to `Viola sp.'.
Data are shown in figures \ref{cdrABC-plants} and \ref{cdrD-plants}.

\subsection{hays-plants}
Data were downloaded from Ecological Archives \citep{hay_data}.
We removed unknown species, and data points categorized as `short grass', `Fragment', and `Bare ground'. 
Moreover, we identified seven issues with species identification. 
First, we removed individuals identified a the genus level for \textit{Ambrosia}, \textit{Oxalis}, and \textit{Solidago}. 
In these genera more than 95\% of individuals were identified at the species level. 
Second, we `lumped' to genus level, species belonging to the general \textit{Allium}, \textit{Chamaesyce}, \textit{Opuntia}, \textit{Polygala}. 
In these genera, more than 5\% of counts were identified at the genus level. 
Finally, we only retained the 14 plots with continuous replication between 1938 and 1973.
Data are shown in Figure \ref{hays-plants}.

\subsection{jrn-plants}
We downloaded the data from ecological archives \citep{chapline_jornada_2017}. We retained data from 10 plots sampled 19 years: from 1915 to 1938 with five gaps (1918, 1922, 1926, 1929-1930, and 1934). We removed data from individuals not identified to genus or species. Finally, we lumped taxonomic data at the genus level in case over 5\% of individual data points were identified at the genus level; conversely, if this percentage was lower than 5\%, we discarded data identified at the genus level. Data are shown in Figure \ref{jrn-plants}.

%\subsection{jrn-plants}
%Data were downloaded from EDI \citep{jrn-plants}.
%We selected a subsample of 10 quadrats that provided 18 sampling occasions over 24 years (1915-1938). We only kept data from the years where all 10 quadrats were sampled.
%This is a small subsample of the 114 quadrats that make up this incredible dataset. 
%We then dropped or lumped taxonomic identifiers, because several counts were assigned to a genus rather than to a species. 
%For 25 genera contained in this dataset, counts were sometimes assigned to a species (e.g. \textit{Poa secunda}) or to a genus (e.g. \textit{Poa spp.}). 
%In such cases, we calculated the total proportion (within the entire dataset) of counts assigned to a genus level. 
%When the percentage of counts identified to a genus were less than 5$\%$ of the total counts, we discarded the information. 
%However, when the the percentage of counts identified at the genus level was more than 5$\%$, we lumped all of the counts assigned to a species into a single genus. 
%We did this because such high proportion of counts assigned to a genus, rather than a species, suggests high uncertainty in species identification.
%NOTE: the species accumulation curve in this dataset saturated quite rapidly. This is potentially an artifact of "lumping" specific information to the genus level. 
%Data are shown in Figure \ref{jrn-plants}.

\subsection{sev-plants}
Data were downloaded from EDI \citep{sev-plants}.
This dataset has a consistent spatio-temporal sampling: quadrats, within four transects (N,S,R,V) within two plots, all at one site, sampled twice a year (spring and fall). 
There is, however, a third plot (plot number 3) that contains four new transects (A,B,C,D), which contain 5 - rather than 10 - quadrats each. 
Moreover, the replicates have been occasionally censused in winter, but not consistently through the years. 
Therefore, we removed plot 3 and winter censuses.
We then removed NAs in species counts and species identity, and summed species counts across the 10 quadrats contained in each transect. 
Finally, the "DATE" variable is defined as ``year.month'' (hence, 2000.5 refers to year 2000 in May). 
We chose to have season 2 (spring) correspond to May, and season 3 (Fall) correspond to September.
Data are shown in Figure \ref{sev-plants}.

\subsection{sgs-plants}
Data were downloaded from EDI \citep{sgs-plants}.
Plant community composition on the three grassland and three shrubland small mammal trapping webs (hereafter called `sites'; n = 6). 
Vegetation measurements were made once per year, usually in mid-July. 
Percent canopy cover of each plant species was estimated visually in 30 0.10-m$^2$ Daubenmire quadrats on each web. 
We aggregated plant species percent cover data at the site scale because each year, transects and plot locations were determined based on a randomization procedure (3 trap stations were chosen randomly within each site from a list of 12 permanent points, where transects with random orientations were centered on each trap station location). 
Trapping web `31W' was removed because it was sampled in only 2 years (2006 and 2007).
Samples for year 2007 were removed because not all sites were sampled in 2007.
Species codes that did not identify plant species were removed (litter, bare ground, etc.).
Species codes that were otherwise inconsistent (different cases, naming conventions, etc.) were reconciled so that all species were identified by unique 4 letter codes.
Observations for codes that did not represent plants, or plants were unknown or not resolved to species were removed prior to analysis.
Data are shown in Figure \ref{sgs-plants}.

\subsection{sgs-plants}
Data were downloaded from EDI {knb-lter-sgs.527.1}.
We downloaded the dataset from EDI \citep{Milchunas2014}. 
We kept data from 1995 to 2008, discarding data from 1992 and 1993 because of a gap in 1994. 
We only retained sites that were always grazed, which is the natural condition in this ecosystem. 
We took the mean of basal cover across plots. Finally, we removed data points not identified at the species level.

Data are shown in Figure \ref{sgs-plants-compagnoni}.

\subsection {sev-arthropods}
We downloaded this arthropod data (1992-2004) from EDI \citep{lightfoot_ground_2013}. 
To prepare this dataset, we first removed unreliable data points: data from unidentified sites, from sites with inconsistent sampling (sites "P" and "B"), from lines reporting "pooled" data, and from all taxa not identified to the species level. 
Second, we took means of traps within each trap line. 
We took means because sampling frequency is not homogeneously 6 times a year. 
Data are shown in Figure \ref{sev-arthropods}.

\subsection {sev-grasshoppers}
The data (1992-2013) were downloaded from the EDI Data Portal \citep{sev-grasshopper}.
We retained data from only two habitats (Black grama and Creosotebush) that shared many species, and presented 20 years of temporal replication. 
These data were collected twice a year, and spatial replication included site, transect, and web. 
Population (count) data is structured, being collected across sex, age, and substrate. 
We summed numbers across webs, sex, age, and substrate.
Data are shown in Figure \ref{sev-grasshoppers}.

\subsection{cdr-grasshoppers}
Data (1989-2006) were accessed on EDI \citep{cdr-grasshoppers}.
We removed sites `28' and `11', which were added to the sampling after 1989. 
Then, we summed the number of individuals across all life stages and all months. 
We summed across months even in 2003, when June and August samples were lost for some fields. 
However, as the documentation reports, ``The total counts for these fields were augmented by proportional additions from remaining samples by John Haarstad and crew".
Taxonomic information is available for only for the {\it Acrididae} family before 1994. 
We lumped taxonomic identifications to genus level for {\it Conocephalus}, {\it Scudderia}, and {\it Tetrix}, as over 5$\%$ of individuals from these genera were not identified at the species level. 
6$\%$ of individuals belonging to the {\it Melanoplus} genus were identified at the genus level: however, we did not lump this data to the genus level, because {\it Melanoplus} contains 12 out of the 50 species of this dataset. We removed the individuals identified as belonging to {\it Melanoplus} without being identified to species. 
Data are shown in Figure \ref{cdr-grasshoppers}.

\subsection{knz-grasshoppers}
Data on grasshopper abundance (1996-2015) were downloaded from  EDI \citep{knz-grasshoppers}.
We retained 13 spatial replicates which provide continuous temporal replicates from 1995 to 2013 (2012 is missing). 
We lumped taxonomic information level whenever the counts at the genus level made up more than 5$\%$ of the total individuals counted. 
We did not do this lumping for {\it Melanopus} spp. because it is a hyperdiverse genus. 
In this case, we dropped all {\it Melanopus} records identified at the genus level. 
Finally, we averaged count data across a year, because some spatial replicates could occasionally contain more observations within a year.
Data are shown in Figure \ref{knz-grasshoppers}.

\subsection{luq-snails}
We downloaded these data on snail abundance (1991-2017) from EDI \citep{luq-snails}.
We averaged number of snails across runs (``Run.ID" in dataset) and seasons (``Seasons" in dataset). 
There were no codes for unknown or non-living taxa.
We only retained sites which were present in every year of the dataset.
Data are shown in Figure \ref{luq-snails}.

\subsection {jrn-lizards}
The data were downloaded from the EDI Data Portal \citep{jrn-lizard}.
Data were gathered in a mark-recapture study. 
Pitfall traps were opened for two weeks four times per year (quarterly). 
The monthly samples from 1990 and 1991 were removed.
Individual lizards were identified and the number of unique individuals per site per year were summed. 
Two sites that were established five years after the start of the study (SUMM and NORT) were excluded. 
%We don't have a key to the species codes.
Data are shown in Figure \ref{jrn-lizards}.
%The cumulative number of taxa was still increasing at the end of the time series, although with only 20 species total one or two species introductions could cause this pattern.

\subsection {cap-herps}
The data were downloaded from the EDI Data Portal \citep{cap-herps}.
Herpetofauna occurrence data were gathered in a visual encounter survey.
Observations were nested by 3 plots within 3 transects per site. 
Each site represents the reach level (each reach level site is composed of 3 transects with equal area sampling efforts). 
Surveys from 2012 and March were dropped to standardize sampling efforts temporally. 
%Unidentified species were dropped, species code is the scientific name of species. 
Taxon count was calculated as the maximum abundance per year in any one of the sampling events (with 3 sampling events per reach in April/May, June/July, and September/October). 
%The final community dataset prepared for analysis has 7 sites representative of the reach level metacommunity dynamics (3 transects sampled per reach) from 2013-2017 with a total of 18 observed species across all sites.  
Data are shown in Figure \ref{cap-herps}.

\subsection {and-birds}
The data were downloaded from the EDI Data Portal \citep{and-birds}.
We used data from the first five years of study (2009 - 2013) because six counts per season were conducted in those years.
We summed the counts of new individuals observed within the closest distance radius ($<$ 50 m)  of the points during the 10-minute interval for on each sampling occasion, and used the maximum number of individuals of each species recorded at each point as the abundance value for that year.
Data are shown in Figure \ref{and-birds}.

\subsection{cap-birds}
Data were obtained from EDI \citep{cap-birds}.
This is a point count study where birds were observed (seen or heard) for 15 minutes within a 40 m fixed radius. 
Each site represents one point count. 
Only ESCA point counts are included. 
Data from 2017 were dropped because not all sites were sampled. 
Four point count sites (M-9, V-18, X-8, and V-16) were dropped due to uneven sampling across years. 
Unidentified species accounted for less then 2\% of the total data and were dropped. 
%Species codes are 4-letter codes (https://www.wintuaudubon.org/Documents/Alpha_codes_eng.pdf). 
Taxon count was calculated as the maximum abundance per year during the spring month's sampling events (with 3 sampling events per site between March, April, and May). 
Data are shown in Figure \ref{cap-birds}.

\subsection{bes-birds}
Data were downloaded from EDI \citep{bes-birds}. We dropped all observations in the distance catagory ``FT" and all observations not identified to species. 
We only used sites with surveys every year from 2005-2009. 
When there was multiple surveys per year for a single site, the abundance counts were aggregated to the maximum observed count from any survey for each species at the respective site.
We only included plots in which at least one bird was observed in each year of study.
Data are shown in (Figure \ref{bes-birds}).
